<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
  Throughout the course, I'll be pointing you towards awesome tools, links,
  resources, background reading and fun tidbits that help you learn web
  development. I'll mention them in the videos. But I've also collated all of
  them together grouped by module, so you can easily find them all in one place
  instead of digging though the video lessons.

  Head over to the link below and bookmark it, so whenever you need a link
  you'll be able to refer to the list.
