Hi guys it's Angela from the apiary.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:08,610
And in this lesson we're going to deep dive into how exactly does the Internet actually work.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,600
Because here's the thing that we use every single day and we completely take it for granted.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,020
So before we start developing awesome Web sites and web apps for people to access through the Internet

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,440
it's really important that we understand the fundamentals of how the Internet actually works.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,840
So what exactly is the Internet.

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,610
Well a lot of people think of it as a cloud.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,510
Something that's hanging around in the sky it's super complex super difficult to understand but actually

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,890
that's not it at all.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,520
The Internet is really simple.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,860
All it is is just a long piece of wire.

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,610
And the wire connects different computers to each other.

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,230
So you might have one computer that's in Seattle and another computer that's in London and they can

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,230
talk to each other and transfer data through this giant wire.

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,250
Now some of these computers attached to the internet have a very special job.

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:08,900
They have to be online 24/7 ready to serve you all of the data and the files that you are requesting.

17
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:14,700
When you try to access web sites and the computers that are doing that job we would call a server and

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,440
the computers that any user would use to access the internet is called a client.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,830
Now you can imagine a web server as a giant library that's open 24/7 and you can go in there at any

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,680
hour of the day and request I want to see Google's home page or I want to see the latest post on Tech

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,050
Crunch and it would be up to serve you with all of the files and data that you would need to be able

22
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,200
to view whatever web site it is that you requested.

23
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,570
Now you can imagine if there's a library that's big enough to house all of these Web sites then it's

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,910
going to be pretty difficult to quickly locate the thing that you want out of this giant library.

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,310
Right.

26
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,840
So how is this problem solved on the Internet.

27
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,130
Well let's say that you're sitting at home on your computer and you type in Google dot com because you

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,270
want to head over to the main Google home page.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,980
What happens behind the scenes is that your browser will send a message to your Internet service provider.

30
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,010
So these are the people who you pay to be able to access the Internet.

31
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,810
And if you're in the US that's a company like AT&amp;T or Comcast and if you're in the U.K. then that would

32
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,760
be something like BT or TalkTalk.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,050
Now the message that you're sending the ISP is I want to see Google dot com and the ISP will then relay

34
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:36,030
that message to something called a DNS server a domain name system server and a DNS server is essentially

35
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,190
just a souped up phone book.

36
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,390
And what happens when you make that request through your browser is the DNS server will look up in its

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,770
database as to what is the exact IP address of that Web site that you're trying to access and every

38
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,330
single computer that's connected to the internet has an IP address.

39
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:03,330
This is like a postal address for your computer so that when people need to send and receive files on

40
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,100
the Internet each computer can be located by a unique IP address.

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,040
And once that DNS server finds the IP address it sends that back to your browser.

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,230
So now you know the exact address where you can find the Google home page.

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,920
So the next thing that happens is you will send a direct request to that address through your Internet

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,950
service provider.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And this message will be delivered via what's called the Internet backbone.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,750
Now the Internet backbone isn't some sort of analogy for some clever programming.

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,630
It's literally the backbone of the Internet.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,910
And if you had a submarine cable map dot com you can view all of the underwater cables that power the

49
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:55,380
Internet and the Internet is made up of these huge sprawling masses of wires connecting all of the world's

50
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,810
Internet users as you can imagine.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a pretty complex world out there.

52
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,350
Now if I'm sitting in London and I want to see a Web site that's hosted in the United States then my

53
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,780
browser would have to make a request that goes through one of these cables under the Atlantic Ocean

54
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,200
in order to reach the United States.

55
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,390
And once that computers receive my request they'll send back all of the relevant data again through

56
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:27,630
these giant cables and to navigate all of this crazy underwater and above water wires.

57
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,180
All I have is an IP address.

58
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,180
It's like as if I'm sending a letter halfway across the world and my only hope for my letter to reach

59
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,710
my friend is that postal address on the front of the envelope.

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,200
So once I've gotten the IP address of the website that I want to access then my browser sends another

61
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,190
message through the Internet service provider via the Internet backbone to the server that is located

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:01,950
at that address 2 1 6 5 8 to 10 46 and the computer that's located at that address is of course the

63
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:08,640
Google server and on the server there's all of the files I would need in order to be able to view the

64
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,030
Google home page.

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,930
So the server then sends all of those files back to me through the Internet backbone and I get to see

66
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,930
the Google home page in my browser and all of that happens in a matter of milliseconds.

67
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,720
And just to imagine the journey that my data has gone on traveling through the world thousands of times

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,380
per day.

69
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,060
So why don't you give it a go.

70
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:39,630
Open up your browser and type in 2 1 6 5 8 to 10 4:6 and hit enter to see the Google home page being

71
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,190
served up to you being served up to you through the Internet.
