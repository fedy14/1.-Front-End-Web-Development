1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,140
All right.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:07,920
So first things first before we do anything else we first have to get set up and ready for web development.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,650
So I'm going to walk you through a couple of applications that you'll be using pretty much full time

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,210
during this course.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,900
There's two major tools that we'll rely on and that is going to be the Chrome browser and the answer

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,070
text editor.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,190
And between these two tools we're going to achieve a lot.

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,920
And later on in the courtroom we're introducing more advanced concepts such as using the command line

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,770
or using a database.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,330
Then we'll install other things as we go along.

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,780
But to get started the most important applications we need to install are just these two.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,860
Now you might already have chrome installed but if you don't then be sure to check out the Web Development

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:55,640
Course resources list which are linked to in this current lesson and it's really really important that

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,260
you check over here because every single time I mentioned Malenko every single time I try to point you

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,420
towards something the length it will show up over here and you'll be able to click on it to save you

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,680
all the trouble of having to type it all out.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,410
First things first.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,320
If you don't have chrome installed then open up this page in your browser and just click on this link

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,340
to go ahead and download and install Chrome.

20
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,020
And that should be pretty simple and it will guide you through the process.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,090
Now the other thing that will need is the atom text editor.

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:33,200
And this is really really useful for creating a development environment where we'll be able to write

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,720
all code and it's completely free to download and install.

24
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:44,240
So if you just head over to atom dot IO or go through the Web development course resource list then

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,180
you should land on this page and it very cleverly figures out what system you have that you're running.

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,330
For example at the moment I'm running Mac OS and I'm on Mac OS ten point nine or later.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,450
So all you have to do is just go ahead and click download and once download has completed then you can

28
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,620
simply head over to your Downloads folder and DoubleClick to unzip that package.

29
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,550
And now you will see awesome show up.

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,240
The last thing you have to do is just to move this application into your applications folder on the

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,800
Mac it's just a matter of heading over to your Macintosh harddrive and then your Applications folder

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:30,630
and then dragging in that atom application that you just downloaded in your downloads over into here

33
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,120
and then you're all done and you're set up with Atom.

34
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:41,310
Now if your Windows user and you head over to atom you'll see that it automatically detect that you

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,800
are viewing this on a Windows computer.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,500
And then you can just go ahead and again click that big yellow download button and you should end up

37
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,110
with something that's called something like Adsum setup.

38
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,860
You see and you'll be able to see this in your Downloads folder.

39
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,110
So now if you just double click on that and it will automatically do everything it needs to install

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,760
awesome on your system.

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,330
So once you're done it should open up a new window.

42
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:17,380
Like so and you would have successfully installed atom and the power of atom really comes from their

43
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,980
packages so you can see that they have over a thousand packages which are bunches of code that other

44
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,850
programmers have written to make your experience of using atom better.

45
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:36,520
So you can put in custom things such as display a clock in the atom status bar or other things such

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,550
as having the file icons next to each of your files or something that's way more practical which is

47
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,610
things like ads and beautify which just beautifies an indent your code for you.

48
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,600
So these are really really powerful and we're going to customize it for the course.

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,860
So again he had back over to the Web Development Course resourcefulness.

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,910
You'll see that there is a list of added packages that we want you to install.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,360
And these are the ones which are recommended and these are the ones which are optional.

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,400
All you have to do is open up atom and go to preferences and then go to install.

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,740
And I want you to search for each of these.

54
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,250
And then just go ahead and install it so you can simply just copy and paste it into here and you'll

55
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,790
see the one that should match up exactly with the name that you see over here.

56
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,400
And then just go ahead and click install.

57
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,590
And on Windows is absolutely exactly the same.

58
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,270
And once you have installed all of your packages then you should be able to view them over here.

59
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,160
And some of these that I listed as optional are just things that make life a little bit easier for us.

60
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,340
But the ones which are recommended are things that we'll be using throughout the course so things such

61
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,360
as Autor clothes H.T. mail which automatically closes your H.M. tags.

62
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,060
We'll see that in use other things such as Emett will auto suggest bits of code that we need and in

63
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,760
order to see what I see on screen when you work alongside the tutorials it's a good idea to install

64
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,280
all of the recommended packages.

65
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,880
Now a lot of the packages are to do with our lenders and lenders are kind of like what it sounds like

66
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,910
it picks out lint from your code.

67
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,440
Right.

68
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,370
It tries to suggest maybe places where you can improve or places where you're not conforming to best

69
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,510
practice.

70
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,850
And it really helps you to improve your code.

71
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,530
So now that you're all set up with your packages you are ready to go and get started with web development.

72
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,900
So I will see you on the next lesson.
