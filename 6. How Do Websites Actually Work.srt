1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,500
So now that we've spoken about how the Internet works in this episode I want to talk about how exactly

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,980
do Web site work.

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:12,800
What exactly does a TMLC SS and Javascript do exactly.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,850
Now in order to access a web page we all know that you need a browser right and that can be Chrome Safari

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,160
Firefox whatever is your favorite one.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,810
These are all pieces of software that allow you to look up the IP address of your web site and be able

7
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:36,860
to receive data that it can render into these beautiful Web sites that we see now the data that you

8
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,410
receive from the server usually consists of three types of files.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,270
H TMLC SS and Javascript.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,570
And it's very likely that you would have come across these types of files or these words before because

11
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,490
they're so common and they're so integral to how web sites work.

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:59,850
But what exactly do they do and why are there so many different types of files.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,440
Why can't we just have one file that's you know a Web site.

14
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,260
Well they actually have very different jobs.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,520
The m code file is responsible for the structure of your web site.

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:17,990
So if a Web site was a house then the h him l would be the builder who would come in to build the walls

17
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,780
or put in a toilet.

18
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:26,630
Basically they establish the structure of your house and when you write HMO code you also build up the

19
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,620
structure of your website so you could use the amount add an image or button or text box whatever it

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,890
is that you need in your website.

21
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,950
Now the second type of file or CSSA files and these files are responsible for styling your Web site.

22
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,740
So if you are building a house then this would be the painters and decorators they would be going around

23
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:55,610
painting the walls or adding stylistic flourishes to your place and generally making the place look

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,110
the way that you want it to.

25
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,380
And that's exactly what CSSA code does as well.

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:06,000
When you incorporate CSSA it allows you to specify how you want your Web site to look.

27
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,410
So you could say that yes I have a button that I got from my age to mail but that button I want it to

28
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,040
be red and I want the text to be white and I want the font of the tax to be an aerial that is all done

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,960
using CSSA code.

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,830
Now the final component is the javascript code and this is the code that allows your Web site to actually

31
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,410
do things or have behavior.

32
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,180
And if you are building a house you would have the electrician come in who would be able to connect

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,520
the wires so that your lightbulbs actually switch on or somebody who comes in and does the plumbing

34
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,360
so that your toilet can actually flush and the javascript code does exactly that.

35
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,000
It allows your Web site to actually do things and have behavior.

36
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,970
So for example that person I added earlier on with my age HTML code only when I have the javascript

37
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,620
code can I actually make it do something interesting like send off an email.

38
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,470
So if we take the Google web site as an example again once we receive these files from Google server

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,110
when our browser loads up the ASTM l files will get to see the structure of the Web site.

40
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,900
Namely there's one image which has their logo.

41
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,130
There's two buttons and there's a text box where we can enter our search.

42
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:26,560
Now when we receive the CSSA files then that will modify the appearance of all of those components.

43
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:33,590
We don't have any more buttons or any more images but they now look the way that Google wanted it to.

44
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:41,150
And finally when we incorporate the javascript files then our website actually starts having behavior

45
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,540
has functionality and is actually able to do something rather than just display some images and text

46
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,140
to us.

47
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,390
Now with the knowledge that we've already acquired we can already start messing around with web sites

48
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,640
on the Internet.

49
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,760
So open up chrome and head over to tech crunch dot com.

50
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,080
And if you're not familiar with it it's basically a technology news Web site where I get my latest tech

51
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,780
news.

52
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:13,180
Now once you're over here I want you to right click on the title here and click on inspect.

53
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,760
Now this brings up the chrome developer tools and we're going to be exploring this in a lot more detail.

54
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,610
But for now we're going to use it to do something really simple.

55
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:30,020
You can see that when I right click on that heading and click inspect it automatically opens up the

56
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,100
entire code file that was used to render this website.

57
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,740
So these are all of the elements that make up this Web site.

58
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:44,720
And when you click on inspect it will highlight to you the part of the code that corresponds to the

59
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,380
thing that you right clicked right.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
In this case it's this title.

61
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,340
And inside this title you can see that there is a link which means that when you click on it.

62
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,770
It'll go to another web page but it's also got a bit of text.

63
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,580
So right inside chrome developer tools if you double click on the bit of text that corresponds to the

64
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,640
title you can actually edit it.

65
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,380
So let's go ahead and change the front page of tech crunch.

66
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,520
Let's say something like

67
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,400
So this is a great way of pranking your friends especially when they can see that you're on Tech Crunch

68
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,040
dotcom.

69
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,540
And the title of any of the text on the Web site is what you wanted to say and this is a great joke

70
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,850
to play on friends who are maybe not quite as technologically advanced as you because they haven't taken

71
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,330
the course that you have now unfortunately.

72
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,300
When I hit refresh on this Web site all of my good work is gone.

73
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:49,660
And the reason is because when I'm editing it here inside my browser I'm actually changing the local

74
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:56,950
copy of this file that I got back from the Google servers but when I click refresh then that makes a

75
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:02,280
new request to the Google servers to load up a fresh copy of the Web site.

76
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,110
So of course then an update to the original content but in the coming lessons we're going to be working

77
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:15,960
with HMO CSSA and Javascript so that you can create and host live on the internet your very own Web

78
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,340
sites and through learning how to code and how to build web sites you're going to be able to make websites

79
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,250
that say anything that you wanted to look the way that you wanted to and have the functionality that

80
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,230
you need.

81
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,150
So all of that and more.

82
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,780
I'll see you on the next lesson.
